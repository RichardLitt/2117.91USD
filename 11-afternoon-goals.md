# Afternoon goals

I went home, turned on Star Trek, ate some leftover roast, and had a wee meditation session / nap. Now, I feel a lot better.

I don't like my approach to this entire thing. I feel that it is too adhoc, and not targeted. This is one of the reasons that 2tothe20th, another similar project I had (without the debt goal) a few years ago failed. I shouldn't fall into this trap, but I did.

I also felt a bit rejected by the guy on Twitter not following up. I should have seen that coming, and that's the risk of reaching out in that way. I can't melt iron to make tools without sometimes getting burned. Moving right along.

What's next for me? Well, I want to choose a particular project. I'm not sure what that is. But I also _do_ need to get through my emails and my general projects this afternoon, and to get to my newsletters. I'm going to go and market this whole project now by dropping it in my various communities (like I mentioned in [Marketing This Project](9-marketing-this-project.md)) now, and then slash and burn my inbox while I let comments filter in.
