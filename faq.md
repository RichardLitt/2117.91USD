# FAQ

## How?

I have no idea. I'm going to figure that out next. This is where I will be logging my efforts.

## How can I follow along?

- Watch or Star this repository.
- Hit me up on Twitter! Ping [@richlitt](https://twitter.com/richlitt). I'm watching everything today. Or send me an email.

## What is this repository

I am starting this repo as a place to _blog_ about my efforts. Why here? Because I tend to write Markdown, and GitHub displays that just fine. And because I don't actually need more than that. I'm used to Git, and this will leave me with an interesting publishing platform.

## Why 2117.91? That seems oddly specific.

It's the amount of money in one of my US Government Stafford Loans, set at 6.5%APR. I want to see how fast I can get rid of it. This is an attempt to do that fast.

## ... By Sunday?

Arbitrary constraints are assets. I'm hoping that this goal will help give me the illusion of scarcity of time, which will make me think a bit more creatively about how to accomplish my goal.

## Can I help?

Of course! [Open an issue](https://github.com/RichardLitt/2117.91USD/issues/new) with your questions, or write me at [richard+2117@burntfen.com](mailto:richard+2117@burntfen.com), or hit me up on Twitter at [@richlitt](https://twitter.com/richlitt).

## If you want to donate money.

I am _not_ a charity case. I plan to make money by providing services. But if you're a charitable person, I certainly won't stop you. üôá‚Äç
