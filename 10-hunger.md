# Hunger

Buffer doesn't have a public SDK or API that they're using right now, which basically means I'd be stuck implementing a basic one myself or using the unofficial version. I think that would work, but I think the whole Buffer idea is putting the cart before the horse - this isn't a massive need for me at the moment, and I don't think it's the most lucrative for the next few days. I reached out to their Director of Engineering on Twitter about getting an email for Maintainer. That might work, but if it doesn't, that's OK. I think I can help them there, and in the long term, so it's not really in the spirit of this sprint - that's just basic marketing.

And now I am really hungry, and worried I rushed that whole connection. Ah well. We'll see!

So, now I'm hungry. I've made $10. Time to put all of this on the backburner and go and let my passive mind deal with things for a bit. Taking a break will help me be refreshed later.

My BPM is apparently at 75; I thought it would be higher. I think I just have low blood sugar right now, as I haven't eaten in five hours. Ok, let's go do that.
