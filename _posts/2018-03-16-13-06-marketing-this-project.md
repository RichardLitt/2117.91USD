I've been working on this project for a couple of hours now. I've made some money, which is great, and I've had a lot of personal connections come forward and make some stuff happen. But I'm afraid I am limiting myself to people on Twitter. I want more than that. I haven't marketed this to _any_ of my alumni networks, or my newsletters.

I think it is time I did that. So, this is the time to figure out that plan. Networks to reach out to:

- [ ] Hacker Paradise
- [ ] altMBA
  - [ ] yolk17
- [ ] Erasmus Mundus?
- [ ] Make Awesome Shit (personal friend's Slack)
- [ ] Patreon
- [ ] Les Pitonneux
- [ ] Open Source Montreal
- [ ] Changelog
- [ ] Boston Tech
- [ ] NomadList
- [ ] Ghost Influence // Elevation Mavericks
- [ ] JS Montreal
- [ ] Facebook
- [ ] Instagram

What services am I pitching to each of these? For instance, I could easily reach out to a few networks where the main thing people would need would be websites. But I don't necessarily want to build websites for people. I want to build beautiful art things and/or help make people's lives better. So, that's really not that useful.

One thing I could do would be to reach out with ads for various small projects:

- [ ] Nomad As Fuck
- [ ] The Travel Shelf
- [ ] Word Hoard Press
- [ ] The User Is My Mom
- [ ] The User Is Drunk
- [ ] The User Is Sober // UX Reviews
- [ ] Antinomadic
- [ ] Carbon Zero Expeditions

For each of these, I might be able to actually sell the individual services at a premium, or plan new ways of making money and marketing them in the short term. That'd be worth spending some time with.

Professional networks are also interesting. The timing of this project is bizarre; I basically can't depend on any money being spent from businesses. It's got to be from persons, as the weekend cuts into most active working hours for people.

Aside: I keep getting drawn into conversation with Thomas, and my ability to focus is flagging. I need to go home and eat.

Ok, let's start with the easiest to market: the main project, to the main lists. How can I do that easiest? Probably by just dropping the link in, and by asking how I can help people. I want people to think about how they could use my ingenuity and effort for them, not just for myself - otherwise, this turns into begging, not into a desire for exchanges which use fiat currency as the currency.
