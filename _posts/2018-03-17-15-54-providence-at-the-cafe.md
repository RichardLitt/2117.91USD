While I am busy working on the Probot app, I kept looking over my monitor at another person here at the cafe who had a ton of stickers on his laptop - almost all of them about infosec, but one for [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/). I figure that Unsplash has a large presence here in Montr√©al, and this is probably one of their developers. He looked like a friendly developer, and I wanted advice - so, I walked over, introduced myself, and asked what he's working on. Then, I explained what I'm working on, and asked if he had a couple of minutes to talk about Jekyll scheduling.

He pointed out that I really don't need to actually have a ton of instances, and that I can use Heroku's cronjob for this job just fine. He also thinks the dual approach is good - one paid, one not paid. So, I'm going to go forward with that. (Come to think of it, [License Zero](https://writing.kemitchell.com/2017/09/12/The-License-Zero-Manifesto.html) might be good for this, too).

I asked if he wanted to help out - he said he might later. I'm excited about that!

At the same time, [Andrew Nesbitt](https://twitter.com/teabass/status/975094441764585473) of [Tidelift](https://tidelift.com/) reached out on Twitter and said that I could work at my normal fee - in this case, $75 seems to be a good amount, and is what I list on [Maintainer.io] - for auditing and doing documentation work for a project on [Open Collective](https://maintainer.io/). I will put in an hour later today or tomorrow (time permitting) - but, for now, that generous offer is another $75 towards my goal. I'm very excited about this, because it'll give me an opportunity to bill through [my Maintainer Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/maintainer) which I _haven't_ actually done yet. I can't wait for this experiment. More on this later.
