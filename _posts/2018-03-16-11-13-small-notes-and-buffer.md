Started a new way of writing these. Just number them, don't write the heading until afterwards. Then, rename them. By the way, I am writing these in Atom, although iA Writer is my favourite writing program. Atom is closer to the code.

I had some weird issues with Buffer. It was hard to set the time for close tweets - I had to manually click the right time. I wonder if there is an easier programmatic way. Something to look into. No interaction with those recent tweets either - worrying?

I just had my call with Brian. He and I are going to work on the marathon training for July together, now, as accountability partners. Once a week setups.

- [ ] Look into programmatic Buffer posting
- [ ] Schedule a marathon training meetup with Brian next week
  - [ ] Ask about what runkeeper he uses

He also said he was reading Ukrainian National Geographics. I am curious about what those look like. Might be fun to start a National Geographic covers website. I've asked him to email the National Geographics covers he has to me as pictures. This might be the right time to learn flexgrid.

- [ ] Set up National Geographic website

This post is not really coherent. I'm going to wait posting it until something more meaningful happens.

## Buffer

Ok, there is a JavaScript wrapper for their API, [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/buffer-node). It's run by a third party, and isn't used much. I wonder why that is? Buffer has an [Open Source page](https://bufferapp.github.io/), but it's not very well done; it is mostly just links to GitHub repositories, and it doesn't talk about the kind of work that Buffer does for open source, or why it is an open source company. It's more a registry that I could find at [@bufferapp](https://github.com/bufferapp) on GitHub.

I've [pinged](https://twitter.com/richlitt/status/974662242640842752) a few developers about the API, there. I'm going to contact my personal contact at Buffer, too - he might be interested in @mntnr's work, I think. That might be a good venue.

One idea that occurs to me is to build a simple scheduler for Buffer's API, and release it as open source. Make a CLI tool for it, or an app online where people can pay for using it by just typing in dates. It's an idea.
