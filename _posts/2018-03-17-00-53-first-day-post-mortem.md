Three hours after saying I'd start work on a blog, I have one up. It's still not entirely perfect - for instance, I need to include a section that says _why_ I am live blogging this thing, and that this site isn't necessarily to bring in money by itself, but to point out the efforts I am doing to make money elsewhere. This is just a way of me making the entire process public, because, frankly, that's not a bad marketing scheme.

Now I have a headache from dealing with Jekyll, although this site was one of the easier one's I've built. The question is: how did my first day go?

First, I'm unhappy with the amount of breaks I took. I didn't work from around 2:00 until around 10:00. That's not ideal. I did work from 9:00 to 2:00, and from 10:00 to 1:00, so, that's actually a full workday, but I'd rather not stay up this long.

Second, I wish I had been clearer from the get-go that this journaling isn't, in itself, useful towards making money. It's just a way for me to be able to have other people come on board and see what I am doing. I've spent too much time on it, time which could have been better spent actually working on products that might bring in income. Don't focus on the project if there's no monetization scheme if you want money, basically - by sinking all of this time into this, I didn't sink time elsewhere. You live, you learn. At this point, I think it's pretty set up, so I may not have to worry about that tomorrow.

Third, I wish I had been able to enrol some others easier. I had a few offers of help, but wasn't able to bring them on board to help out. That means all of my work is just multiplied by one. Not ideal. I'll have to work on that tomorrow.

Fourth, I wish I had built the adventure marketing site instead of this site. But I had a need I wanted to fill - how to blog like this - and now it's done. You win, you lose. And I do like tinkering on Jekyll sites.

Overall, I had a fantastic, enjoyable day. I made some money - thanks Dean! - got some offers for more - thanks Zach! - and learned a lot. I learned what to do, and a few things not to do. Good.

Now I'm going to bed.
