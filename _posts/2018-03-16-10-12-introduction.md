Around 15 minutes ago, I remembered that this is what I am doing today, and decided to just go for it. This may be an incredibly stupid idea. Here are the issues with it:

- For one, I only have one day to hit up people at work. This severly limits my ability to actually sell services to companies.
- Three days is an incredibly short time to sell something of worth that people are going to buy, and it's not enough time at all to market to others.
- The goal on the _money_ as opposed to the _value_ I provide to others is a negative. I'll need to intentionally offset this in my thinking as much as possible. The real goal is to provided $2000 in value, not just in exchange.

(Actually, for that last point: It might be worth removing the donate buttons from my front page. That makes me feel like I am dependant on charity. I'm not. I'll revisit this later. That may have a poor marketing aspect. For now, I've added in a note that I am not a charity.)

I set up this GitHub repository to be my blog, so that people can follow along. I plan to tweet about it as I go along, too. It might be interesting to make an automatic GitHub Blog to Twitter conversion kit, actually, that people could use to do things like this.

Let's scope that out next. I've opened an issue for that in #1.

## What's next?

Well, I have a few things I need to do today.

- [x] [Maintainer.io](https://maintainer.io) tickets. Every day, I check all of the issues that are new for my clients for whom I do issue triaging and community management. I've already done this today. Good.
- [ ] Write a [Weekly Newsletter](https://tinyletter.com/richlitt). I can use this as a launching platform for this.
- [ ] Write a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/home) newsletter and send it to them. I've got a few patrons there, and they expect one newsletter a week.
- [ ] Emails. I need to basically go through them and figure out what should be done. More on that when I get to it.
- [ ] Review the [Open Source Cities](https://github.com/opensourcecities/montreal/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc) new website. I've been a few weeks late on this one, due to focusing on my thesis.
- [ ] Brunch with Pablo?
- [ ] Maybe a party tonight with Ian? Probably going to miss this, but it's there.

I think that's it, for my actual needs for the day. Besides that, I'm wide open.

First, let's tweet the basic repository, and then let's add this Introduction post to [Buffer](http://buffer.com/) for the time being. Actually, I'm using GitHub, Twitter, and Buffer for this. Maybe I should reach out to them and ask for sponsorship? Maybe I can make a site for this blog on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), too, and then reach out to them.

I've opened #2 and #3 just now for those. Ok, let's go.
