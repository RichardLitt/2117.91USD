I got [a comment from Twitter](https://twitter.com/lisah/status/975066054761353216) from someone who read my last post, pointed out where I mentioned that I could get a job but don't, and where I mentioned that I am sad about my level of privilege. She then responded with "Oh, you poor dear. #tinyviolin". I didn't respond as well as I should've, mostly because I felt like my actual issues - the fact that I still need to find ways to overcome my debt, and that I need love and affection just like anyone else - were being minimized.

After some conversation, I realized I was taking the whole thing too hard, and that her comment wasn't constructive, or nice. And I don't want to engage with comments that aren't constructive or nice. So, enough with that.

I have some thoughts about why this is art, and how it could be misperceived. This entire project has some issues, and I am - I think - aware of them.

- **People may not see it as art.** This is an exploration of whether or not it is possible to name an issue I have in my life (in this case, debt), and, by choosing a really small deadline in which to act, to overcome it. It is an exploration, a scientific study on setting intent and simulating scarcity. It is not my career model for my life, and it is not meant to replace my job.
- **People may see this blog as the means of making money.** It isn't. I shouldn't be blogging at all. I am writing here because I want to share my experience. It is a monumental waste of effort that could be better spent actually making products and services for people.
- **People may presuppose that this is me asking for money about my debt.** It isn't. I am not a charity case. I have enough money, right now, to pay this small loan off. What I am interested in is whether or not I can turn a liability into an asset. I chose one of my loans as an arbitrary catalyst. I plan to provide services and value for the money I receive.
- **People may think that I should get a job, instead.** I do not believe the myth that a 9-5, regular job is the only way to make capital. In my case, it is not what has proven in the past to make me happy, and I think that there are more creative ways I can make money. Modern capitalism doesn't demand that you be a worker, it just demands that your provide perceived value and are fiscally remunerated for that perceived value.
- **People may think that pointing out my hardships (debt) is not wholesome, or manly, or polite.** I don't have an answer for this one. I wish we talked about our issues more openly, as a society, because it would encourage empathy.
- **My sense of privilege and network are necessary for this, and it is graceless to point that out.** Yes, I have privilege and an extensive network. However, I also have a right to self expression, and I also have my own struggles. Comparison of hardships doesn't remove hardships from the person who has less. Are my issues less? Yes. Are they real? Yes. Should I use my network and position to alleviate them? I don't see a reason why I shouldn't. Is it perhaps more morally virtuous to ignore them and help out the less privileged all of the time? Sure, but I don't think that that is mandatory. I'm willing to read more on this.

I'm 100% hoping that someone responds to this and helps me grow. I want to further conversation on this topic, and on whether or not this was an interesting idea.

Now, back to providing value.
