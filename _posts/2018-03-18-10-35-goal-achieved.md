At 10:15 this morning, I officially passed my goal. I've got enough money from various sources to cover my student loan. ðŸ˜ƒ

I went to sleep at around 3:00am last night, and woke up at 8:00 this morning. There were a few tweets - some from [Kristof](https://twitter.com/ssstofff). When I checked my email a few minutes later, I had been given $25 - thanks, Kristof!

The rest of the tweets were from [Andrew Nesbitt](https://twitter.com/teabass), who runs quite a few projects on [Open Collective](http://opencollective.com/). A short video call later, and I'm going to be doing a documentation and community audit of [splitrb](https://github.com/splitrb). My normal rates for this work on [Maintainer Mountaineer](https://maintainer.io/) are $500 for an org. But Andrew also wants me to look at [24PullRequests](https://twitter.com/24pullrequests) and [Octobox](https://octobox.io/), all using Open Collective money, which means the goal is passed. He's not worrying about me doing it today, and I'm not worried about that, either - the lion's share of the money that helped with this goal came from a two-week contract I'll be doing with another alumnus of the altMBA, after all. But for all intents and purposes, my goal has been reached.

I'm super happy and excited. I did not expect to actually reach this, and not without bending over backwards to try and market some saas product. But - I didn't have to. People reached out, I'm providing solid value for my dollars, and everyone goes home happy.

Being free to bill now and do the work later frees me up today to work on what I want to do - which is get this Jekyll scheduler thing working. So, that's my plan for the rest of the day. I may fiddle around here and there with some other things - I have some drawings I want to make and install in a local cafe later today - but for now, let's get on with my little Mongo // Heroku // GitHub // Node // Express // Stripe integration project.

Woohoo! ðŸŒŸ
