title: The First Tweet

I just tweeted ["I'm going on an experiment. Want to follow along and join me? For the next three days, I'm going to be seeing if I can earn $2000 to pay off a student loan I have. I'm live-blogging my entire process, here."](https://twitter.com/richlitt/status/974650005041696768) It was the first tweet.

Twitter said that I could reach more if I pay. It suggested $500, to reach 130k people. I don't think I need to spend that much money for that, and it also only said I could reach Canada, Quebec, or Montreal people. Screw that. I'll see if my local networks are interested, first.

I need a few things:
- [x] A counter to show my progress
- [x] A way for people to feel involved besides just reading. Twitter?

I just renamed this post to 'The First Tweet' from 'Launching'. I'll need to remember to name sections appropriately.

## Post mortem

Ok, those first two things are done. Let's start using post-mortems to do this sort of thing.

Oh, shoot, I never schedule the second post. Let's do that now.
