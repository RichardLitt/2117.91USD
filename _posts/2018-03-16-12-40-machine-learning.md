title: Machine Learning?

After closing my first sale, I got a bit distracted. First, I was going to run home to work on my lunch. Then, however, my friend Thomas Getgood walked into my cafe. Thomas is an awesome programmer, who brews his own beer, roasts his own coffee, and sometimes tries to build a fusion reactor in his apartment. He wants to work on machine learning this weekend.

As it happens, I think that sounds cool. I proposed a deal; let's see if we can find a project, and I'll give him half of any proceeds we might make by marketing it and helping code it.

So, we spend a bit thinking about what we could do. I was thinking about a running newsletter and app, but then discarded that as not being easy enough with AI.

Then, we hit on code comparison. Could we build a machine that learns the style of code from a coder, and makes PRs or suggestions to compared code? Can you make my code look like the best JavaScripters? Could you endorse different code syntaxes I don't use very often, and highlight them to me? There are a ton of applications.

I put Thomas onto research by Charles Sutton in Edinburgh, who does this sort of comparison (I almost applied to a PhD under him, years ago). For now, he's reading away, and I'm thinking about the next thing I can do.

@flexdinesh also messaged about possibly helping out. I've got to think about a way to bring in more developers on this project.
