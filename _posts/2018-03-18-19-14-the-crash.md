I figured out my problem with iPhoto, and why I was so annoyed at it.

I was incredibly tired. I don't function very well on multiple nights of poor sleep, and last night I only got five hours. Too much caffeine today, and it was inevitable that I was going to pass out.

After writing the last post, I took a nap, then a bath, and watched some of _The Princess Bride_. There's no reason entrepreneurialism has to take all of Sunday, too. Now, refreshed, I'm making dinner; tonight, I'll work for a few more hours and see if I can plan and act on wrapping this up.

No lessons in this post, no discussions about code problems. Just a note that I'm human, and therefore an animal, and therefore limited by physical needs. I should have planned for anger earlier.
