I didn't like the navigation, so I added a post option in and made the links better on the website. This is the main problem with websites. Endless fiddling.

Anyway, that's all I am going to do tonight on this blog.

Edit: Scratch that. I edited the rake task to make it so I never have to manually make a post page again. Nothing like some late-night ruby to remind you that you're actually a competent coder.
